# Game-Playing-AI <br>


**Project Template: Artificial Intelligence** <br>
**Project Idea Title 1: Kane and Abel: AIs that play games** <br>
The idea for the project (based on the template): The game I’ve chosen is Tic-Tac-Toe where I plan to build two systems. Kane would be the rule based gameplay and Abel would be AI driven. <br>

**Tic Tac Toe Basics:** <br>
Grid: 3x3 <br>
Players: X and O <br>
Goal: Get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. <br>

**Motivation for the project:** I’m motivated by the desire to explore the contrasts and potential synergies between rule-based AI (e.g. in IBM Deep Blue) and machine learning AI (e.g. AlphaGo and OpenAI's Dota 2 AI) within a simple, accessible game environment
